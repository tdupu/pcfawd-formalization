# Challenge: characteristic-zero paper headline statements

This statement surface imports only Mathlib. The definitions below are copied
from the existing root statement surface, independently of its proof modules.
Normalized PCF means finiteness of the forward images of ramified divisors on
the normalization. Theorem A concerns the actual reduced closure of an iterate
of a codimension-one point and every map satisfying its restriction square.
The two nonvacuity theorems guarantee normalization lifts and restrictions exist;
the latter is unique because its inclusion is a closed immersion.

The corollary expresses divisor descent through every finite depth. The source
proof also supplies dimension termination and the automatic zero-dimensional
case. No complete geometric example or characteristic-p result is selected.
The compared headline proofs in the Solution explicitly use
`PaperCharZero.theoremA` and `PaperCharZero.cor_pcfawd` respectively.

discrete valuation rings. -/
